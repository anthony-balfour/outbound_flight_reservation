# flight-reserve-backend
Full stack example flight reservation website.<br>
Users can view flights, book flights, sign in and out, create an account, look at flight deals, and toggle through different view for flights (list vs grid).<br> 
The website data is managed through an SQLite database. <br>
The backend is managed with node.js. <br>
I created and implemented the API endpoints which get various flight and user information. <br>
The app is partly mobile responsive for major sections (landing page and flights page). The code is fully documented.
