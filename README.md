# flight-reserve-backend
Full stack example flight reservation website. Users can view flights, book flights, sign in and out, create an account, look at flight deals, and toggle through different view for flights (list vs grid). The website data is managed through an SQLite database uses node.js as a backend. I created and implemented the API endpoints.
