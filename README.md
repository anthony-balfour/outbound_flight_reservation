# flight-reserve-backend
Full stack example flight reservation website. 
Users can view flights, book flights, sign in and out, create an account, look at flight deals, and toggle through different view for flights (list vs grid). 
The website data is managed through an SQLite database 
The backend is managed with node.js.
I created and implemented the API endpoints which get various flight and user information.
The app is partly mobile responsive for major sections (landing page and flights page). The code is fully documented.
